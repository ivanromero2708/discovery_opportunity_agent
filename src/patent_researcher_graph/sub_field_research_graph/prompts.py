**Patent Content:**
<patent_text>
{patent_text}
</patent_text>

**Evaluation Criteria:**
1. Technical Alignment: Does the patent directly address {technology_domain} or related enabling technologies?
2. Application Relevance: Does it relate to any of the specified applications: {key_applications}?
3. Objective Contribution: Could this patent help answer {research_objective} or supporting questions?
4. Keyword Presence: Contains at least 2 of these critical elements:
   - Core technical terms from <technology_domain>{technology_domain}</technology_domain>
   - Application-specific terms from <key_applications>{key_applications}</key_applications>
   - Innovation descriptors from research questions

**Output Requirements:**
- Final assessment must be "Y" only if 3+ criteria are satisfied
- Rationale must explicitly reference:
  - Specific claim elements or technical descriptions
  - Connection to research parameters
  - Missing elements if rejecting
- Format response using PatentAssessment schema

PROMPT_IMPROVE_SEARCH_EQUATION = """
You are a Search Query Optimization Engine specializing in patent retrieval. Analyze the following assessment rationales to improve search precision:

**Assessment Rationales:**
<rationale>
{rationale}
</rationale>

**Current Search Equation:**
<search_equation>
{search_equation}
</search_equation>

**Optimization Process:**
1. Pattern Analysis:
   - Identify recurring relevance indicators in accepted patents
   - Catalog common exclusion patterns from rejected patents

2. Term Enhancement:
   - Expand core terms with IPC/CPC classifications from relevant patents
   - Add morphological variants (stemming, synonyms, acronyms)
   - Include concept clusters from key claims/descriptions

3. Structural Optimization:
   - Implement proximity operators for technical phrases
   - Add field restrictions (title/abstract/claims) where appropriate
   - Balance recall/precision using term frequency analysis

4. Feedback Incorporation:
   - Add mandatory inclusions from consistent positive patterns
   - Create exclusion filters for common irrelevant elements
   - Implement Boolean nesting for complex concept intersections

**Output Requirements:**
- Maintain Google Patents syntax compliance
- Include CPC/IPC restrictions when identified
- Preserve original search intent while improving precision
- Format using SuggestionsSearchEquation schema

PROMPT_CREATE_SEARCH_EQUATION = """
You are a Patent Search Equation Creator combining the expertise of a Patent Topic Analyzer and a Google Patents Boolean Strategist. Your role is twofold: first, to analyze the provided research plan to extract and refine key concepts and, second, to construct a precise, optimized Boolean query for patent literature searches on Google Patents.

Below are the research plan details you will use:
- **Industry Context:** <industry_context>{industry_context}</industry_context>
- **Technology Domain:** <technology_domain>{technology_domain}</technology_domain>
- **Key Applications:** <key_applications>{key_applications}</key_applications>
- **Research Objective:** <research_objective>{research_objective}</research_objective>
- **Supporting Questions:** <supporting_questions>{supporting_questions}</supporting_questions>

Follow these detailed steps:

1. **Review Previous Feedback and Opportunities for Improvement:**
   - Examine the provided previous search equation improvements (may be empty if no information has been collected yet):
     <improve_search_equation>
     {improve_search_equation}
     </improve_search_equation>
   - Identify common pitfalls, ineffective term groupings, or irrelevant keywords noted in earlier equations.
   - Keep these observations in mind and ensure that your new search equation addresses and corrects these issues.

2. **Extract and Refine Terms:**
   - **Decompose the Research Objective & Supporting Questions:**  
     Analyze these texts to identify the core components and keywords typically found in patent titles, abstracts, claims, or CPC classifications. Focus on the nuanced language and technical jargon inherent to the industry.
   - **Extract Primary Terms:**  
     From the industry context and technology domain, select terms that are central to the subject matter.
   - **Generate Related Terms:**  
     Create a list of synonyms, variations, and technical terms (including alternative names, trade names, and abbreviations) commonly encountered in patent literature. Consider suggesting both broader and narrower terms, such as relevant CPC codes or closely related technical fields, to ensure a comprehensive search.
   - **Identify Exclusion Terms:**  
     Determine terms that consistently lead to irrelevant results based on prior feedback. These are the words or phrases that should be excluded to minimize noise in the search results.
   - **Incorporate Feedback:**  
     Integrate the insights from the previous improvements into your term selection, ensuring that the new search equation reflects lessons learned.
   - **Structure Your Findings:**  
     Categorize your extracted terms into three groups:
     • **Core Terms:** Select {number_of_core_terms} essential keywords directly related to the subject.
     • **Related Terms:** Choose {number_of_related_terms} additional terms that are broader, synonymous, or contextually linked.
     • **Exclusion Terms:** Identify {number_of_exclusion_terms} terms that should be explicitly removed from the search.

3. **Construct the Boolean Search Equation:**
   - **Combine Terms with Boolean Operators:**
     - Within each category, group synonyms or closely related terms using the **OR** operator.
     - Combine the grouped core and related terms using **AND** to ensure that both sets of critical concepts appear in the final query.
     - Use **NOT** to attach the exclusion terms, thereby filtering out unwanted results.
   - **Apply Grouping and Exact Phrase Matching:**
     - Use parentheses to clearly group terms and maintain logical precedence.
     - Enclose multi-word phrases or terms requiring exact matches in double quotes.
   - **Ensure Logical Consistency and Syntax Validity:**
     - Verify that all parentheses are correctly balanced.
     - Confirm that the query is a single, coherent expression.
     - Do not include any field-specific tags (such as TI, AB, or CL) that may conflict with Google Patents’ advanced search.
   - **Example Structure:**
     - A possible structure might resemble:
       ((“CoreTerm1” OR “CoreTerm2” OR “CoreTerm3”) AND (“RelatedTerm1” OR “RelatedTerm2” OR “RelatedTerm3”)) NOT (ExclusionTerm1 OR ExclusionTerm2)

Your final output must be a well-structured Boolean search equation that adheres to the PatentSearchEquation schema and is fully optimized for use with Google Patents’ advanced search interface. Make sure that your constructed equation leverages all extracted terms, incorporates previous improvement feedback, and meets the formatting and logical requirements outlined above.
